      The least that Findlayson, of the Public Works Department, expected was a
      C.I.E.; he dreamed of a C.S.I. Indeed, his friends told him that he
      deserved more. For three years he had endured heat and cold,
      disappointment, discomfort, danger, and disease, with responsibility
      almost to top-heavy for one pair of shoulders; and day by day, through
      that time, the great Kashi Bridge over the Ganges had grown under his
      charge. Now, in less than three months, if all went well, his Excellency
      the Viceroy would open the bridge in state, an archbishop would bless it,
      and the first trainload of soldiers would come over it, and there would be
      speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findlayson, C. E., sat in his trolley on a construction line that ran
      along one of the main revetments&mdash;the huge stone-faced banks that
      flared away north and south for three miles on either side of the river
      and permitted himself to think of the end. With its approaches, his work
      was one mile and three-quarters in length; a lattice-girder bridge,
      trussed with the Findlayson truss standing on seven-and-twenty brick
      piers. Each one of those piers was twenty-four feet in diameter, capped
      with red Agra stone and sunk eighty feet below the shifting sand of the
      Ganges&rsquo; bed. Above them was a railway-line fifteen feet broad; above that,
      again, a cart-road of eighteen feet, flanked with footpaths. At either end
      rose towers, of red brick, loopholed for musketry and pierced for big
      guns, and the ramp of the road was being pushed forward to their haunches.
      The raw earth-ends were crawling and alive with hundreds upon hundreds of
      tiny asses climbing out of the yawning borrow-pit below with sackfuls of
      stuff; and the hot afternoon air was filled with the noise of hooves, the
      rattle of the drivers&rsquo; sticks, and the swish and roll-down of the dirt.
      The river was very low, and on the dazzling white sand between the three
      centre piers stood squat cribs of railway-sleepers, filled within and
      daubed without with mud, to support the last of the girders as those were
      riveted up. In the little deep water left by the drought, an overhead
      crane travelled to and fro along its spile-pier, jerking sections of iron
      into place, snorting and backing and grunting as an elephant grunts in the
      timberyard. Riveters by the hundred swarmed about the lattice side-work
      and the iron roof of the railway line hung from invisible staging under
      the bellies of the girders, clustered round the throats of the piers, and
      rode on the overhang of the footpath-stanchions; their fire-pots and the
      spurts of flame that answered each hammer-stroke showing no more than pale
      yellow in the sun&rsquo;s glare. East and west and north and south the
      construction-trains rattled and shrieked up and down the embankments, the
      piled trucks of brown and white stone banging behind them till the
      side-boards were unpinned, and with a roar and a grumble a few thousand
      tons&rsquo; more material were flung out to hold the river in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findlayson, C. E., turned on his trolley and looked over the face of the
      country that he had changed for seven miles around. Looked back on the
      humming village of five thousand work-men; up stream and down, along the
      vista of spurs and sand; across the river to the far piers, lessening in
      the haze; overhead to the guard-towers&mdash;and only he knew how strong
      those were&mdash;and with a sigh of contentment saw that his work was
      good. There stood his bridge before him in the sunlight, lacking only a
      few weeks&rsquo; work on the girders of the three middle piers&mdash;his bridge,
      raw and ugly as original sin, but pukka&mdash;permanent&mdash;to endure
      when all memory of the builder, yea, even of the splendid Findlayson
      truss, has perished. Practically, the thing was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitchcock, his assistant, cantered along the line on a little
      switch-tailed Kabuli pony who through long practice could have trotted
      securely over trestle, and nodded to his chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All but,&rdquo; said he, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it,&rdquo; the senior answered. &ldquo;Not half a bad job
      for two men, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One&mdash;and a half. &lsquo;Gad, what a Cooper&rsquo;s Hill cub I was when I came on
      the works!&rdquo; Hitchcock felt very old in the crowded experiences of the past
      three years, that had taught him power and responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were rather a colt,&rdquo; said Findlayson. &ldquo;I wonder how you&rsquo;ll like going
      back to office-work when this job&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall hate it!&rdquo; said the young man, and as he went on his eye followed
      Findlayson&rsquo;s, and he muttered, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it damned good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll go up the service together,&rdquo; Findlayson said to himself.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too good a youngster to waste on another man. Cub thou wast;
      assistant thou art. Personal assistant, and at Simla, thou shalt be, if
      any credit comes to me out of the business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, the burden of the work had fallen altogether on Findlayson and his
      assistant, the young man whom he had chosen because of his rawness to
      break to his own needs. There were labour contractors by the half-hundred&mdash;fitters
      and riveters, European, borrowed from the railway workshops, with,
      perhaps, twenty white and half-caste subordinates to direct, under
      direction, the bevies of workmen&mdash;but none knew better than these
      two, who trusted each other, how the underlings were not to be trusted.
      They had been tried many times in sudden crises&mdash;by slipping of
      booms, by breaking of tackle, failure of cranes, and the wrath of the
      river&mdash;but no stress had brought to light any man among men whom
      Findlayson and Hitchcock would have honoured by working as remorselessly
      as they worked them-selves. Findlayson thought it over from the beginning:
      the months of office-work destroyed at a blow when the Government of
      India, at the last moment, added two feet to the width of the bridge,
      under the impression that bridges were cut out of paper, and so brought to
      ruin at least half an acre of calculations&mdash;and Hitchcock, new to
      disappointment, buried his head in his arms and wept; the heart-breaking
      delays over the filling of the contracts in England; the futile
      correspondences hinting at great wealth of commissions if one, only one,
      rather doubtful consignment were passed; the war that followed the
      refusal; the careful, polite obstruction at the other end that followed
      the war, till young Hitchcock, putting one month&rsquo;s leave to another month,
      and borrowing ten days from Findlayson, spent his poor little savings of a
      year in a wild dash to London, and there, as his own tongue asserted and
      the later consignments proved, put the fear of God into a man so great
      that he feared only Parliament and said so till Hitchcock wrought with him
      across his own dinner table, and&mdash;he feared the Kashi Bridge and all
      who spoke in its name. Then there was the cholera that came in the night
      to the village by the bridge works; and after the cholera smote the
      small-pox. The fever they had always with them. Hitchcock had been
      appointed a magistrate of the third class with whipping powers, for the
      better government of the community, and Findlayson watched him wield his
      powers temperately, learning what to overlook and what to look after. It
      was a long, long reverie, and it covered storm, sudden freshets, death in
      every manner and shape, violent and awful rage against red tape half
      frenzying a mind that knows it should be busy on other things; drought,
      sanitation, finance; birth, wedding, burial, and riot in the village of
      twenty warring castes; argument, expostulation, persuasion, and the blank
      despair that a man goes to bed upon, thankful that his rifle is all in
      pieces in the gun-case. Behind everything rose the black frame of the
      Kashi Bridge&mdash;plate by plate, girder by girder, span by span&mdash;and
      each pier of it recalled Hitchcock, the all-round man, who had stood by
      his chief without failing from the very first to this last.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the bridge was two men&rsquo;s work&mdash;unless one counted Peroo, as Peroo
      certainly counted himself. He was a Lascar, a Kharva from Bulsar, familiar
      with every port between Rockhampton and London, who had risen to the rank
      of serang on the British India boats, but wearying of routine musters and
      clean clothes, had thrown up the service and gone inland, where men of his
      calibre were sure of employment. For his knowledge of tackle and the
      handling of heavy weights, Peroo was worth almost any price he might have
      chosen to put upon his services; but custom decreed the wage of the
      overhead-men, and Peroo was not within many silver pieces of his proper
      value. Neither running water nor extreme heights made him afraid; and, as
      an ex-serang, he knew how to hold authority. No piece of iron was so big
      or so badly placed that Peroo could not devise a tackle to lift it&mdash;a
      loose-ended, sagging arrangement, rigged with a scandalous amount of
      talking, but perfectly equal to the work in hand. It was Peroo who had
      saved the girder of Number Seven pier from destruction when the new
      wire-rope jammed in the eye of the crane, and the huge plate tilted in its
      slings, threatening to slide out sideways. Then the native workmen lost
      their heads with great shoutings, and Hitchcock&rsquo;s right arm was broken by
      a falling T-plate, and he buttoned it up in his coat and swooned, and came
      to and directed for four hours till Peroo, from the top of the crane,
      reported &ldquo;All&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; and the plate swung home. There was no one like
      Peroo, serang, to lash, and guy, and hold, to control the donkey-engines,
      to hoist a fallen locomotive craftily out of the borrow-pit into which it
      had tumbled; to strip, and dive, if need be, to see how the concrete
      blocks round the piers stood the scouring of Mother Gunga, or to adventure
      upstream on a monsoon night and report on the state of the
      embankment-facings. He would interrupt the field-councils of Findlayson
      and Hitchcock without fear, till his wonderful English, or his still more
      wonderful linguafranca, half Portuguese and half Malay, ran out and he was
      forced to take string and show the knots that he would recommend. He
      controlled his own gang of tackle men&mdash;mysterious relatives from
      Kutch Mandvi gathered month by month and tried to the uttermost. No
      consideration of family or kin allowed Peroo to keep weak hands or a giddy
      head on the pay-roll. &ldquo;My honour is the honour of this bridge,&rdquo; he would
      say to the about-to-be-dismissed. &ldquo;What do I care for your honour? Go and
      work on a steamer. That is all you are fit for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little cluster of huts where he and his gang lived centred round the
      tattered dwelling of a sea-priest&mdash;one who had never set foot on
      black water, but had been chosen as ghostly counsellor by two generations
      of sea-rovers all unaffected by port missions or those creeds which are
      thrust upon sailors by agencies along Thames bank. The priest of the
      Lascars had nothing to do with their caste, or indeed with anything at
      all. He ate the offerings of his church, and slept and smoked, and slept
      again, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said Peroo, who had haled him a thousand miles inland, &ldquo;he
      is a very holy man. He never cares what you eat so long as you do not eat
      beef, and that is good, because on land we worship Shiva, we Kharvas; but
      at sea on the Kumpani&rsquo;s boats we attend strictly to the orders of the
      Burra Malum [the first mate], and on this bridge we observe what Finlinson
      Sahib says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Finlinson Sahib had that day given orders to clear the scaffolding from
      the guard-tower on the right bank, and Peroo with his mates was casting
      loose and lowering down the bamboo poles and planks as swiftly as ever
      they had whipped the cargo out of a coaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his trolley he could hear the whistle of the serang&rsquo;s silver pipe and
      the creek and clatter of the pulleys. Peroo was standing on the top-most
      coping of the tower, clad in the blue dungaree of his abandoned service,
      and as Findlayson motioned to him to be careful, for his was no life to
      throw away, he gripped the last pole, and, shading his eyes ship-fashion,
      answered with the long-drawn wail of the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle lookout: &ldquo;Ham dekhta
      hai&rdquo; (&ldquo;I am looking out&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Findlayson laughed and then sighed. It was years since he had seen a
      steamer, and he was sick for home. As his trolley passed under the tower,
      Peroo descended by a rope, ape-fashion, and cried: &ldquo;It looks well now,
      Sahib. Our bridge is all but done. What think you Mother Gunga will say
      when the rail runs over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has said little so far. It was never Mother Gunga that delayed us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is always time for her; and none the less there has been delay. Has
      the Sahib forgotten last autumn&rsquo;s flood, when the stone-boats were sunk
      without warning&mdash;or only a half-day&rsquo;s warning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but nothing save a big flood could hurt us now. The spurs are
      holding well on the West Bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Gunga eats great allowances. There is always room for more stone
      on the revetments. I tell this to the Chota Sahib,&rdquo;&mdash;he meant
      Hitchcock&mdash;&ldquo;and he laughs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, Peroo. Another year thou wilt be able to build a bridge in
      thine own fashion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Lascar grinned. &ldquo;Then it will not be in this way&mdash;with stonework
      sunk under water, as the Qyetta was sunk. I like sus-sus-pen-sheen bridges
      that fly from bank to bank with one big step, like a gang-plank. Then no
      water can hurt. When does the Lord Sahib come to open the bridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In three months, when the weather is cooler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! ho! He is like the Burra Malum. He sleeps below while the work is
      being done. Then he comes upon the quarter-deck and touches with his
      finger, and says: &lsquo;This is not clean! Dam jibboonwallah!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Lord Sahib does not call me a dam jibboonwallah, Peroo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sahib; but he does not come on deck till the work is all finished.
      Even the Burra Malum of the Nerbudda said once at Tuticorin&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! Go! I am busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, also!&rdquo; said Peroo, with an unshaken countenance. &ldquo;May I take the light
      dinghy now and row along the spurs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hold them with thy hands? They are, I think, sufficiently heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Sahib. It is thus. At sea, on the Black Water, we have room to be
      blown up and down without care. Here we have no room at all. Look you, we
      have put the river into a dock, and run her between stone sills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Findlayson smiled at the &ldquo;we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have bitted and bridled her. She is not like the sea, that can beat
      against a soft beach. She is Mother Gunga&mdash;in irons.&rdquo; His voice fell
      a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peroo, thou hast been up and down the world more even than I. Speak true
      talk, now. How much dost thou in thy heart believe of Mother Gunga?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that our priest says. London is London, Sahib. Sydney is Sydney, and
      Port Darwin is Port Darwin. Also Mother Gunga is Mother Gunga, and when I
      come back to her banks I know this and worship. In London I did poojah to
      the big temple by the river for the sake of the God within. . . . Yes, I
      will not take the cushions in the dinghy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Findlayson mounted his horse and trotted to the shed of a bungalow that he
      shared with his assistant. The place had become home to him in the last
      three years. He had grilled in the heat, sweated in the rains, and
      shivered with fever under the rude thatch roof; the lime-wash beside the
      door was covered with rough drawings and formulae, and the sentry-path
      trodden in the matting of the verandah showed where he had walked alone.
      There is no eight-hour limit to an engineer&rsquo;s work, and the evening meal
      with Hitchcock was eaten booted and spurred: over their cigars they
      listened to the hum of the village as the gangs came up from the river-bed
      and the lights began to twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peroo has gone up the spurs in your dinghy. He&rsquo;s taken a couple of
      nephews with him, and he&rsquo;s lolling in the stern like a commodore,&rdquo; said
      Hitchcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. He&rsquo;s got something on his mind. You&rsquo;d think that ten
      years in the British India boats would have knocked most of his religion
      out of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it has,&rdquo; said Hitchcock, chuckling. &ldquo;I overheard him the other day in
      the middle of a most atheistical talk with that fat old guru of theirs.
      Peroo denied the efficacy of prayer; and wanted the guru to go to sea and
      watch a gale out with him, and see if he could stop a monsoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, if you carried off his guru he&rsquo;d leave us like a shot. He
      was yarning away to me about praying to the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s when he was
      in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me that the first time he went into the engine-room of a steamer,
      when he was a boy, he prayed to the low-pressure cylinder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not half a bad thing to pray to, either. He&rsquo;s propitiating his own Gods
      now, and he wants to know what Mother Gunga will think of a bridge being
      run across her. Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; A shadow darkened the doorway, and a
      telegram was put into Hitchcock&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She ought to be pretty well used to it by this time. Only a tar. It ought
      to be Ralli&rsquo;s answer about the new rivets. . . . Great Heavens!&rdquo; Hitchcock
      jumped to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said the senior, and took the form. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Mother
      Gunga thinks, is it,&rdquo; he said, reading. &ldquo;Keep cool, young &lsquo;un. We&rsquo;ve got
      all our work cut out for us. Let&rsquo;s see. Muir wired half an hour ago:
      &lsquo;Floods on the Ramgunga. Look out.&rsquo; Well, that gives us&mdash;one, two&mdash;nine
      and a half for the flood to reach Melipur Ghaut and seven&rsquo;s sixteen and a
      half to Lataoli&mdash;say fifteen hours before it comes down to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse that hill-fed sewer of a Ramgunga! Findlayson, this is two months
      before anything could have been expected, and the left bank is littered up
      with stuff still. Two full months before the time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why it comes. I&rsquo;ve only known Indian rivers for five-and-twenty
      years, and I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand. Here comes another tar.&rdquo;
       Findlayson opened the telegram. &ldquo;Cockran, this time, from the Ganges
      Canal: &lsquo;Heavy rains here. Bad.&rsquo; He might have saved the last word. Well,
      we don&rsquo;t want to know any more. We&rsquo;ve got to work the gangs all night and
      clean up the riverbed. You&rsquo;ll take the east bank and work out to meet me
      in the middle. Get everything that floats below the bridge: we shall have
      quite enough river-craft coming down adrift anyhow, without letting the
      stone-boats ram the piers. What have you got on the east bank that needs
      looking after?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pontoon&mdash;one big pontoon with the overhead crane on it. T&rsquo;other
      overhead crane on the mended pontoon, with the cart-road rivets from
      Twenty to Twenty-three piers&mdash;two construction lines, and a
      turning-spur. The pilework must take its chance,&rdquo; said Hitchcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Roll up everything you can lay hands on. We&rsquo;ll give the gang
      fifteen minutes more to eat their grub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Close to the verandah stood a big night-gong, never used except for flood,
      or fire in the village. Hitchcock had called for a fresh horse, and was
      off to his side of the bridge when Findlayson took the cloth-bound stick
      and smote with the rubbing stroke that brings out the full thunder of the
      metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before the last rumble ceased every night-gong in the village had
      taken up the warning. To these were added the hoarse screaming of conches
      in the little temples; the throbbing of drums and tom-toms; and, from the
      European quarters, where the riveters lived, McCartney&rsquo;s bugle, a weapon
      of offence on Sundays and festivals, brayed desperately, calling to
      &ldquo;Stables.&rdquo; Engine after engine toiling home along the spurs at the end of
      her day&rsquo;s work whistled in answer till the whistles were answered from the
      far bank. Then the big gong thundered thrice for a sign that it was flood
      and not fire; conch, drum, and whistle echoed the call, and the village
      quivered to the sound of bare feet running upon soft earth. The order in
      all cases was to stand by the day&rsquo;s work and wait instructions. The gangs
      poured by in the dusk; men stopping to knot a loin-cloth or fasten a
      sandal; gang-foremen shouting to their subordinates as they ran or paused
      by the tool-issue sheds for bars and mattocks; locomotives creeping down
      their tracks wheel-deep in the crowd; till the brown torrent disappeared
      into the dusk of the river-bed, raced over the pilework, swarmed along the
      lattices, clustered by the cranes, and stood still&mdash;each man in his
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the troubled beating of the gong carried the order to take up
      everything and bear it beyond high-water mark, and the flare-lamps broke
      out by the hundred between the webs of dull iron as the riveters began a
      night&rsquo;s work, racing against the flood that was to come. The girders of
      the three centre piers&mdash;those that stood on the cribs&mdash;were all
      but in position. They needed just as many rivets as could be driven into
      them, for the flood would assuredly wash out their supports, and the
      ironwork would settle down on the caps of stone if they were not blocked
      at the ends. A hundred crowbars strained at the sleepers of the temporary
      line that fed the unfinished piers. It was heaved up in lengths, loaded
      into trucks, and backed up the bank beyond flood-level by the groaning
      locomotives. The tool-sheds on the sands melted away before the attack of
      shouting armies, and with them went the stacked ranks of Government
      stores, iron-bound boxes of rivets, pliers, cutters, duplicate parts of
      the riveting-machines, spare pumps and chains. The big crane would be the
      last to be shifted, for she was hoisting all the heavy stuff up to the
      main structure of the bridge. The concrete blocks on the fleet of
      stone-boats were dropped overside, where there was any depth of water, to
      guard the piers, and the empty boats themselves were poled under the
      bridge down-stream. It was here that Peroo&rsquo;s pipe shrilled loudest, for
      the first stroke of the big gong had brought the dinghy back at racing
      speed, and Peroo and his people were stripped to the waist, working for
      the honour and credit which are better than life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew she would speak,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I knew, but the telegraph gives us
      good warning. O sons of unthinkable begetting&mdash;children of
      unspeakable shame&mdash;are we here for the look of the thing?&rdquo; It was two
      feet of wire-rope frayed at the ends, and it did wonders as Peroo leaped
      from gunnel to gunnel, shouting the language of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findlayson was more troubled for the stoneboats than anything else.
      McCartney, with his gangs, was blocking up the ends of the three doubtful
      spans, but boats adrift, if the flood chanced to be a high one, might
      endanger the girders; and there was a very fleet in the shrunken channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get them behind the swell of the guardtower,&rdquo; he shouted down to Peroo.
      &ldquo;It will be dead-water there. Get them below the bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accha! [Very good.] I know; we are mooring them with wire-rope,&rdquo; was the
      answer. &ldquo;Heh! Listen to the Chota Sahib. He is working hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From across the river came an almost continuous whistling of locomotives,
      backed by the rumble of stone. Hitchcock at the last minute was spending a
      few hundred more trucks of Tarakee stone in reinforcing his spurs and
      embankments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bridge challenges Mother Gunga,&rdquo; said Peroo, with a laugh. &ldquo;But when
      she talks I know whose voice will be the loudest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For hours the naked men worked, screaming and shouting under the lights.
      It was a hot, moonless night; the end of it was darkened by clouds and a
      sudden squall that made Findlayson very grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She moves!&rdquo; said Peroo, just before the dawn. &ldquo;Mother Gunga is awake!
      Hear!&rdquo; He dipped his hand over the side of a boat and the current mumbled
      on it. A little wave hit the side of a pier with a crisp slap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six hours before her time,&rdquo; said Findlayson, mopping his forehead
      savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we can&rsquo;t depend on anything. We&rsquo;d better clear all hands out of the
      riverbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the big gong beat, and a second time there was the rushing of naked
      feet on earth and ringing iron; the clatter of tools ceased. In the
      silence, men heard the dry yawn of water crawling over thirsty sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foreman after foreman shouted to Findlayson, who had posted himself by the
      guard-tower, that his section of the river-bed had been cleaned out, and
      when the last voice dropped Findlayson hurried over the bridge till the
      iron plating of the permanent way gave place to the temporary plank-walk
      over the three centre piers, and there he met Hitchcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;All clear your side?&rdquo; said Findlayson. The whisper rang in the box of
      lattice work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the east channel&rsquo;s filling now. We&rsquo;re utterly out of our
      reckoning. When is this thing down on us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no saying. She&rsquo;s filling as fast as she can. Look!&rdquo; Findlayson
      pointed to the planks below his feet, where the sand, burned and defiled
      by months of work, was beginning to whisper and fizz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What orders?&rdquo; said Hitchcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call the roll&mdash;count stores sit on your hunkers&mdash;and pray for
      the bridge. That&rsquo;s all I can think of Good night. Don&rsquo;t risk your life
      trying to fish out anything that may go downstream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be as prudent as you are! &lsquo;Night. Heavens, how she&rsquo;s filling!
      Here&rsquo;s the rain in earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Findlayson picked his way back to his bank, sweeping the last of
      McCartney&rsquo;s riveters before him. The gangs had spread themselves along the
      embankments, regardless of the cold rain of the dawn, and there they
      waited for the flood. Only Peroo kept his men together behind the swell of
      the guard-tower, where the stone-boats lay tied fore and aft with hawsers,
      wire-rope, and chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shrill wail ran along the line, growing to a yell, half fear and half
      wonder: the face of the river whitened from bank to hank between the stone
      facings, and the far-away spurs went out in spouts of foam. Mother Gunga
      had come bank-high in haste, and a wall of chocolate-coloured water was
      her messenger. There was a shriek above the roar of the water, the
      complaint of the spans coming down on their blocks as the cribs were
      whirled out from under their bellies. The stone-boats groaned and ground
      each other in the eddy that swung round the abutment, and their clumsy
      masts rose higher and higher against the dim sky-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before she was shut between these walls we knew what she would do. Now
      she is thus cramped God only knows what she will do!&rdquo; said Peroo, watching
      the furious turmoil round the guard-tower. &ldquo;Ohe&rsquo;! Fight, then! Fight hard,
      for it is thus that a woman wears herself out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mother Gunga would not fight as Peroo desired. After the first
      down-stream plunge there came no more walls of water, but the river lifted
      herself bodily, as a snake when she drinks in midsummer, plucking and
      fingering along the revetments, and banking up behind the piers till even
      Findlayson began to recalculate the strength of his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      When day came the village gasped. &ldquo;Only last night,&rdquo; men said, turning to
      each other, &ldquo;it was as a town in the river-bed! Look now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they looked and wondered afresh at the deep water, the racing water
      that licked the throat of the piers. The farther bank was veiled by rain,
      into which the bridge ran out and vanished; the spurs up-stream were
      marked by no more than eddies and spoutings, and down-stream the pent
      river, once freed of her guide-lines, had spread like a sea to the
      horizon. Then hurried by, rolling in the water, dead men and oxen
      together, with here and there a patch of thatched roof that melted when it
      touched a pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big flood,&rdquo; said Peroo, and Findlayson nodded. It was as big a flood as
      he had any wish to watch. His bridge would stand what was upon her now,
      but not very much more, and if by any of a thousand chances there happened
      to be a weakness in the embankments, Mother Gunga would carry his honour
      to the sea with the other raffle. Worst of all, there was nothing to do
      except to sit still; and Findlayson sat still under his macintosh till his
      helmet became pulp on his head, and his boots were over-ankle in mire. He
      took no count of time, for the river was marking the hours, inch by inch
      and foot by foot, along the embankment, and he listened, numb and hungry,
      to the straining of the stone-boats, the hollow thunder under the piers,
      and the hundred noises that make the full note of a flood. Once a dripping
      servant brought him food, but he could not eat; and once he thought that
      he heard a faint toot from a locomotive across the river, and then he
      smiled. The bridge&rsquo;s failure would hurt his assistant not a little, but
      Hitchcock was a young man with his big work yet to do. For himself the
      crash meant everything&mdash;everything that made a hard life worth the
      living. They would say, the men of his own profession . . . he remembered
      the half-pitying things that he himself had said when Lockhart&rsquo;s new
      waterworks burst and broke down in brick-heaps and sludge, and Lockhart&rsquo;s
      spirit broke in him and he died. He remembered what he himself had said
      when the Sumao Bridge went out in the big cyclone by the sea; and most he
      remembered poor Hartopp&rsquo;s face three weeks later, when the shame had
      marked it. His bridge was twice the size of Hartopp&rsquo;s, and it carried the
      Findlayson truss as well as the new pier-shoe&mdash;the Findlayson bolted
      shoe. There were no excuses in his service. Government might listen,
      perhaps, but his own kind would judge him by his bridge, as that stood or
      fell. He went over it in his head, plate by plate, span by span, brick by
      brick, pier by pier, remembering, comparing, estimating, and
      recalculating, lest there should be any mistake; and through the long
      hours and through the flights of formulae that danced and wheeled before
      him a cold fear would come to pinch his heart. His side of the sum was
      beyond question; but what man knew Mother Gunga&rsquo;s arithmetic? Even as he
      was making all sure by the multiplication table, the river might be
      scooping a pot-hole to the very bottom of any one of those eighty-foot
      piers that carried his reputation. Again a servant came to him with food,
      but his mouth was dry, and he could only drink and return to the decimals
      in his brain. And the river was still rising. Peroo, in a mat shelter
      coat, crouched at his feet, watching now his face and now the face of the
      river, but saying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the Lascar rose and floundered through the mud towards the
      village, but he was careful to leave an ally to watch the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he returned, most irreverently driving before him the priest of
      his creed&mdash;a fat old man, with a grey beard that whipped the wind
      with the wet cloth that blew over his shoulder. Never was seen so
      lamentable a guru.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What good are offerings and little kerosene lamps and dry grain,&rdquo; shouted
      Peroo, &ldquo;if squatting in the mud is all that thou canst do? Thou hast dealt
      long with the Gods when they were contented and well-wishing. Now they are
      angry. Speak to them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a man against the wrath of Gods?&rdquo; whined the priest, cowering as
      the wind took him. &ldquo;Let me go to the temple, and I will pray there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son of a pig, pray here! Is there no return for salt fish and curry
      powder and dried onions? Call aloud! Tell Mother Gunga we have had enough.
      Bid her be still for the night. I cannot pray, but I have been serving in
      the Kumpani&rsquo;s boats, and when men did not obey my orders I&mdash;&rdquo; A
      flourish of the wire-rope colt rounded the sentence, and the priest,
      breaking free from his disciple, fled to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fat pig!&rdquo; said Peroo. &ldquo;After all that we have done for him! When the
      flood is down I will see to it that we get a new guru. Finlinson Sahib, it
      darkens for night now, and since yesterday nothing has been eaten. Be
      wise, Sahib. No man can endure watching and great thinking on an empty
      belly. Lie down, Sahib. The river will do what the river will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bridge is mine; I cannot leave it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilt thou hold it up with thy hands, then?&rdquo; said Peroo, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was troubled for my boats and sheers before the flood came. Now we are
      in the hands of the Gods. The Sahib will not eat and lie down? Take these,
      then. They are meat and good toddy together, and they kill all weariness,
      besides the fever that follows the rain. I have eaten nothing else to-day
      at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a small tin tobacco-box from his sodden waist-belt and thrust it
      into Findlayson&rsquo;s hand, saying: &ldquo;Nay, do not be afraid. It is no more than
      opium&mdash;clean Malwa opium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Findlayson shook two or three of the dark-brown pellets into his hand, and
      hardly knowing what he did, swallowed them. The stuff was at least a good
      guard against fever&mdash;the fever that was creeping upon him out of the
      wet mud&mdash;and he had seen what Peroo could do in the stewing mists of
      autumn on the strength of a dose from the tin box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peroo nodded with bright eyes. &ldquo;In a little&mdash;in a little the Sahib
      will find that he thinks well again. I too will&mdash;&rdquo; He dived into his
      treasure-box, resettled the rain-coat over his head, and squatted down to
      watch the boats. It was too dark now to see beyond the first pier, and the
      night seemed to have given the river new strength. Findlayson stood with
      his chin on his chest, thinking. There was one point about one of the
      piers&mdash;the seventh&mdash;that he had not fully settled in his mind.
      The figures would not shape themselves to the eye except one by one and at
      enormous intervals of time. There was a sound rich and mellow in his ears
      like the deepest note of a double-bass&mdash;an entrancing sound upon
      which he pondered for several hours, as it seemed. Then Peroo was at his
      elbow, shouting that a wire hawser had snapped and the stone-boats were
      loose. Findlayson saw the fleet open and swing out fanwise to a long-drawn
      shriek of wire straining across gunnels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tree hit them. They will all go,&rdquo; cried Peroo. &ldquo;The main hawser has
      parted. What does the Sahib do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An immensely complex plan had suddenly flashed into Findlayson&rsquo;s mind. He
      saw the ropes running from boat to boat in straight lines and angles&mdash;each
      rope a line of white fire. But there was one rope which was the master
      rope. He could see that rope. If he could pull it once, it was absolutely
      and mathematically certain that the disordered fleet would reassemble
      itself in the backwater behind the guard-tower. But why, he wondered, was
      Peroo clinging so desperately to his waist as he hastened down the bank?
      It was necessary to put the Lascar aside, gently and slowly, because it
      was necessary to save the boats, and, further, to demonstrate the extreme
      ease of the problem that looked so difficult. And then&mdash;but it was of
      no conceivable importance&mdash;a wire-rope raced through his hand,
      burning it, the high bank disappeared, and with it all the slowly
      dispersing factors of the problem. He was sitting in the rainy darkness&mdash;sitting
      in a boat that spun like a top, and Peroo was standing over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had forgotten,&rdquo; said the Lascar, slowly, &ldquo;that to those fasting and
      unused, the opium is worse than any wine. Those who die in Gunga go to the
      Gods. Still, I have no desire to present myself before such great ones.
      Can the Sahib swim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What need? He can fly&mdash;fly as swiftly as the wind,&rdquo; was the thick
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is mad!&rdquo; muttered Peroo, under his breath. &ldquo;And he threw me aside like
      a bundle of dung-cakes. Well, he will not know his death. The boat cannot
      live an hour here even if she strike nothing. It is not good to look at
      death with a clear eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He refreshed himself again from the tin box, squatted down in the bows of
      the reeling, pegged, and stitched craft, staring through the mist at the
      nothing that was there. A warm drowsiness crept over Findlayson, the Chief
      Engineer, whose duty was with his bridge. The heavy raindrops struck him
      with a thousand tingling little thrills, and the weight of all time since
      time was made hung heavy on his eyelids. He thought and perceived that he
      was perfectly secure, for the water was so solid that a man could surely
      step out upon it, and, standing still with his legs apart to keep his
      balance&mdash;this was the most important point&mdash;would be borne with
      great and easy speed to the shore. But yet a better plan came to him. It
      needed only an exertion of will for the soul to hurl the body ashore as
      wind drives paper, to waft it kite-fashion to the bank. Thereafter&mdash;the
      boat spun dizzily&mdash;suppose the high wind got under the freed body?
      Would it tower up like a kite and pitch headlong on the far-away sands, or
      would it duck about, beyond control, through all eternity? Findlayson
      gripped the gunnel to anchor himself, for it seemed that he was on the
      edge of taking the flight before he had settled all his plans. Opium has
      more effect on the white man than the black. Peroo was only comfortably
      indifferent to accidents. &ldquo;She cannot live,&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Her seams open
      already. If she were even a dinghy with oars we could have ridden it out;
      but a box with holes is no good. Finlinson Sahib, she fills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Accha! I am going away. Come thou also.&rdquo; In his mind, Findlayson had
      already escaped from the boat, and was circling high in air to find a rest
      for the sole of his foot. His body&mdash;he was really sorry for its gross
      helplessness&mdash;lay in the stern, the water rushing about its knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very ridiculous!&rdquo; he said to himself from his eyrie&mdash;&ldquo;that&mdash;is
      Findlayson&mdash;chief of the Kashi Bridge. The poor beast is going to be
      drowned, too. Drowned when it&rsquo;s close to shore. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m on shore
      already. Why doesn&rsquo;t it come along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his intense disgust, he found his soul back in his body again, and that
      body spluttering and choking in deep water. The pain of the reunion was
      atrocious, but it was necessary, also, to fight for the body. He was
      conscious of grasping wildly at wet sand, and striding prodigiously, as
      one strides in a dream, to keep foothold in the swirling water, till at
      last he hauled himself clear of the hold of the river, and dropped,
      panting, on wet earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not this night,&rdquo; said Peroo, in his ear. &ldquo;The Gods have protected us.&rdquo;
       The Lascar moved his feet cautiously, and they rustled among dried stumps.
      &ldquo;This is some island of last year&rsquo;s indigo-crop,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;We shall
      find no men here; but have great care, Sahib; all the snakes of a hundred
      miles have been flooded out. Here comes the lightning, on the heels of the
      wind. Now we shall be able to look; but walk carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Findlayson was far and far beyond any fear of snakes, or indeed any merely
      human emotion. He saw, after he had rubbed the water from his eyes, with
      an immense clearness, and trod, so it seemed to himself with
      world-encompassing strides. Somewhere in the night of time he had built a
      bridge&mdash;a bridge that spanned illimitable levels of shining seas; but
      the Deluge had swept it away, leaving this one island under heaven for
      Findlayson and his companion, sole survivors of the breed of Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      An incessant lightning, forked and blue, showed all that there was to be
      seen on the little patch in the flood&mdash;a clump of thorn, a clump of
      swaying creaking bamboos, and a grey gnarled peepul overshadowing a Hindoo
      shrine, from whose dome floated a tattered red flag. The holy man whose
      summer resting-place it was had long since abandoned it, and the weather
      had broken the red-daubed image of his god. The two men stumbled,
      heavy-limbed and heavy-eyed, over the ashes of a brick-set cooking-place,
      and dropped down under the shelter of the branches, while the rain and
      river roared together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stumps of the indigo crackled, and there was a smell of cattle, as a
      huge and dripping Brahminee bull shouldered his way under the tree. The
      flashes revealed the trident mark of Shiva on his flank, the insolence of
      head and hump, the luminous stag-like eyes, the brow crowned with a wreath
      of sodden marigold blooms, and the silky dewlap that almost swept the
      ground. There was a noise behind him of other beasts coming up from the
      flood-line through the thicket, a sound of heavy feet and deep breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here be more beside ourselves,&rdquo; said Findlayson, his head against the
      treepole, looking through half-shut eyes, wholly at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; said Peroo, thickly, &ldquo;and no small ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they, then? I do not see clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gods. Who else? Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, true! The Gods surely&mdash;the Gods.&rdquo; Findlayson smiled as his head
      fell forward on his chest. Peroo was eminently right. After the Flood, who
      should be alive in the land except the Gods that made it&mdash;the Gods to
      whom his village prayed nightly&mdash;the Gods who were in all men&rsquo;s
      mouths and about all men&rsquo;s ways. He could not raise his head or stir a
      finger for the trance that held him, and Peroo was smiling vacantly at the
      lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bull paused by the shrine, his head lowered to the damp earth. A green
      Parrot in the branches preened his wet wings and screamed against the
      thunder as the circle under the tree filled with the shifting shadows of
      beasts. There was a black Buck at the Bull&rsquo;s heels-such a Buck as
      Findlayson in his far-away life upon earth might have seen in dreams&mdash;a
      Buck with a royal head, ebon back, silver belly, and gleaming straight
      horns. Beside him, her head bowed to the ground, the green eyes burning
      under the heavy brows, with restless tail switching the dead grass, paced
      a Tigress, full-bellied and deep-jowled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bull crouched beside the shrine, and there leaped from the darkness a
      monstrous grey Ape, who seated himself man-wise in the place of the fallen
      image, and the rain spilled like jewels from the hair of his neck and
      shoulders. Other shadows came and went behind the circle, among them a
      drunken Man flourishing staff and drinking-bottle. Then a hoarse bellow
      broke out from near the ground. &ldquo;The flood lessens even now,&rdquo; it cried.
      &ldquo;Hour by hour the water falls, and their bridge still stands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My bridge,&rdquo; said Findlayson to himself &ldquo;That must be very old work now.
      What have the Gods to do with my bridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes rolled in the darkness following the roar. A Mugger&mdash;the
      blunt-nosed, ford-haunting Mugger of the Ganges&mdash;draggled herself
      before the beasts, lashing furiously to right and left with her tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have made it too strong for me. In all this night I have only torn
      away a handful of planks. The walls stand. The towers stand. They have
      chained my flood, and the river is not free any more. Heavenly Ones, take
      this yoke away! Give me clear water between bank and bank! It is I, Mother
      Gunga, that speak. The Justice of the Gods! Deal me the Justice of the
      Gods!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What said I?&rdquo; whispered Peroo. &ldquo;This is in truth a Punchayet of the Gods.
      Now we know that all the world is dead, save you and I, Sahib.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Parrot screamed and fluttered again, and the Tigress, her ears flat to
      her head, snarled wickedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the shadow, a great trunk and gleaming tusks swayed to and
      fro, and a low gurgle broke the silence that followed on the snarl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We be here,&rdquo; said a deep voice, &ldquo;the Great Ones. One only and very many.
      Shiv, my father, is here, with Indra. Kali has spoken already. Hanuman
      listens also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kashi is without her Kotwal to-night,&rdquo; shouted the Man with the
      drinking-bottle, flinging his staff to the ground, while the island rang
      to the baying of hounds. &ldquo;Give her the Justice of the Gods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye were still when they polluted my waters,&rdquo; the great Crocodile
      bellowed. &ldquo;Ye made no sign when my river was trapped between the walls. I
      had no help save my own strength, and that failed&mdash;the strength of
      Mother Gunga failed&mdash;before their guard-towers. What could I do? I
      have done everything. Finish now, Heavenly Ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought the death; I rode the spotted sick-ness from hut to hut of
      their workmen, and yet they would not cease.&rdquo; A nose-slitten, hide-worn
      Ass, lame, scissor-legged, and galled, limped forward. &ldquo;I cast the death
      at them out of my nostrils, but they would not cease.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peroo would have moved, but the opium lay heavy upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; he said, spitting. &ldquo;Here is Sitala herself; Mata&mdash;the
      small-pox. Has the Sahib a handkerchief to put over his face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little help! They fed me the corpses for a month, and I flung them out on
      my sand-bars, but their work went forward. Demons they are, and sons of
      demons! And ye left Mother Gunga alone for their fire-carriage to make a
      mock of The Justice of the Gods on the bridge-builders!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Bull turned the cud in his mouth and answered slowly: &ldquo;If the Justice
      of the Gods caught all who made a mock of holy things there would be many
      dark altars in the land, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this goes beyond a mock,&rdquo; said the Tigress, darting forward a griping
      paw. &ldquo;Thou knowest, Shiv, and ye, too, Heavenly Ones; ye know that they
      have defiled Gunga. Surely they must come to the Destroyer. Let Indra
      judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Buck made no movement as he answered: &ldquo;How long has this evil been?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three years, as men count years,&rdquo; said the Mugger, close pressed to the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Mother Gunga die, then, in a year, that she is so anxious to see
      vengeance now? The deep sea was where she runs but yesterday, and
      to-morrow the sea shall cover her again as the Gods count that which men
      call time. Can any say that this their bridge endures till to-morrow?&rdquo;
       said the Buck.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long hush, and in the clearing of the storm the full moon
      stood up above the dripping trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge ye, then,&rdquo; said the River, sullenly. &ldquo;I have spoken my shame. The
      flood falls still. I can do no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my own part,&rdquo;&mdash;it was the voice of the great Ape seated within
      the shrine&mdash;&ldquo;it pleases me well to watch these men, remembering that
      I also builded no small bridge in the world&rsquo;s youth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say, too,&rdquo; snarled the Tiger, &ldquo;that these men came of the wreck of
      thy armies, Hanuman, and therefore thou hast aided&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They toil as my armies toiled in Lanka, and they believe that their toil
      endures. Indra is too high, but Shiv, thou knowest how the land is
      threaded with their fire-carriages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, I know,&rdquo; said the Bull. &ldquo;Their Gods instructed them in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A laugh ran round the circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their Gods! What should their Gods know? They were born yesterday, and
      those that made them are scarcely yet cold,&rdquo; said the Mugger. &ldquo;To-morrow
      their Gods will die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; said Peroo. &ldquo;Mother Gunga talks good talk. I told that to the
      padre-sahib who preached on the Mombassa, and he asked the Burra Malum to
      put me in irons for a great rudeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely they make these things to please their Gods,&rdquo; said the Bull again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether,&rdquo; the Elephant rolled forth. &ldquo;It is for the profit of my
      mahajuns&mdash;my fat money-lenders that worship me at each new year, when
      they draw my image at the head of the account-books. I, looking over their
      shoulders by lamplight, see that the names in the books are those of men
      in far places&mdash;for all the towns are drawn together by the
      fire-carriage, and the money comes and goes swiftly, and the account-books
      grow as fat as&mdash;myself. And I, who am Ganesh of Good Luck, I bless my
      peoples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have changed the face of the land-which is my land. They have killed
      and made new towns on my banks,&rdquo; said the Mugger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is but the shifting of a little dirt. Let the dirt dig in the dirt if
      it pleases the dirt,&rdquo; answered the Elephant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But afterwards?&rdquo; said the Tiger. &ldquo;Afterwards they will see that Mother
      Gunga can avenge no insult, and they fall away from her first, and later
      from us all, one by one. In the end, Ganesh, we are left with naked
      altars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The drunken Man staggered to his feet, and hiccupped vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kali lies. My sister lies. Also this my stick is the Kotwal of Kashi, and
      he keeps tally of my pilgrims. When the time comes to worship Bhairon-and
      it is always time&mdash;the fire-carriages move one by one, and each bears
      a thousand pilgrims. They do not come afoot any more, but rolling upon
      wheels, and my honour is increased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gunga, I have seen thy bed at Pryag black with the pilgrims,&rdquo; said the
      Ape, leaning forward, &ldquo;and but for the fire-carriage they would have come
      slowly and in fewer numbers. Remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They come to me always,&rdquo; Bhairon went on thickly. &ldquo;By day and night they
      pray to me, all the Common People in the fields and the roads. Who is like
      Bhairon to-day? What talk is this of changing faiths? Is my staff Kotwal
      of Kashi for nothing? He keeps the tally, and he says that never were so
      many altars as today, and the fire-carriage serves them well. Bhairon am I&mdash;Bhairon
      of the Common People, and the chiefest of the Heavenly Ones to-day. Also
      my staff says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace, thou,&rdquo; lowed the Bull. &ldquo;The worship of the schools is mine, and
      they talk very wisely, asking whether I be one or many, as is the delight
      of my people, and ye know what I am. Kali, my wife, thou knowest also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yea, I know,&rdquo; said the Tigress, with lowered head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greater am I than Gunga also. For ye know who moved the minds of men that
      they should count Gunga holy among the rivers. Who die in that water&mdash;ye
      know how men say&mdash;come to us without punishment, and Gunga knows that
      the fire-carriage has borne to her scores upon scores of such anxious
      ones; and Kali knows that she has held her chiefest festivals among the
      pilgrimages that are fed by the fire-carriage. Who smote at Pooree, under
      the Image there, her thousands in a day and a night, and bound the
      sickness to the wheels of the fire-carriages, so that it ran from one end
      of the land to the other? Who but Kali? Before the fire-carriage came it
      was a heavy toil. The fire-carriages have served thee well, Mother of
      Death. But I speak for mine own altars, who am not Bhairon of the Common
      Folk, but Shiv. Men go to and fro, making words and telling talk of
      strange Gods, and I listen. Faith follows faith among my people in the
      schools, and I have no anger; for when all words are said, and the new
      talk is ended, to Shiv men return at the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True. It is true,&rdquo; murmured Hanuman. &ldquo;To Shiv and to the others, mother,
      they return. I creep from temple to temple in the North, where they
      worship one God and His Prophet; and presently my image is alone within
      their shrines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small thanks,&rdquo; said the Buck, turning his head slowly. &ldquo;I am that One and
      His Prophet also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so, father,&rdquo; said Hanuman. &ldquo;And to the South I go who am the oldest
      of the Gods as men know the Gods, and presently I touch the shrines of the
      New Faith and the Woman whom we know is hewn twelve-armed, and still they
      call her Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small thanks, brother,&rdquo; said the Tigress. &ldquo;I am that Woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so, sister; and I go West among the fire-carriages, and stand before
      the bridge-builders in many shapes, and because of me they change their
      faiths and are very wise. Ho! ho! I am the builder of bridges, indeed&mdash;bridges
      between this and that, and each bridge leads surely to Us in the end. Be
      content, Gunga. Neither these men nor those that follow them mock thee at
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I alone, then, Heavenly Ones? Shall I smooth out my flood lest
      unhappily I bear away their walls? Will Indra dry my springs in the hills
      and make me crawl humbly between their wharfs? Shall I bury me in the sand
      ere I offend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all for the sake of a little iron bar with the fire-carriage atop.
      Truly, Mother Gunga is always young!&rdquo; said Ganesh the Elephant. &ldquo;A child
      had not spoken more foolishly. Let the dirt dig in the dirt ere it return
      to the dirt. I know only that my people grow rich and praise me. Shiv has
      said that the men of the schools do not forget; Bhairon is content for his
      crowd of the Common People; and Hanuman laughs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely I laugh,&rdquo; said the Ape. &ldquo;My altars are few beside those of Ganesh
      or Bhairon, but the fire-carriages bring me new worshippers from beyond
      the Black Water&mdash;the men who believe that their God is toil. I run
      before them beckoning, and they follow Hanuman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give them the toil that they desire, then,&rdquo; said the River. &ldquo;Make a bar
      across my flood and throw the water back upon the bridge. Once thou wast
      strong in Lanka, Hanuman. Stoop and lift my bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who gives life can take life.&rdquo; The Ape scratched in the mud with a long
      forefinger. &ldquo;And yet, who would profit by the killing? Very many would
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There came up from the water a snatch of a love-song such as the boys sing
      when they watch their cattle in the noon heats of late spring. The Parrot
      screamed joyously, sidling along his branch with lowered head as the song
      grew louder, and in a patch of clear moonlight stood revealed the young
      herd, the darling of the Gopis, the idol of dreaming maids and of mothers
      ere their children are born Krishna the Well-beloved. He stooped to knot
      up his long wet hair, and the Parrot fluttered to his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fleeting and singing, and singing and fleeting,&rdquo; hiccupped Bhairon.
      &ldquo;Those make thee late for the council, brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then?&rdquo; said Krishna, with a laugh, throwing back his head. &ldquo;Ye can do
      little without me or Karma here.&rdquo; He fondled the Parrot&rsquo;s plumage and
      laughed again. &ldquo;What is this sitting and talking together? I heard Mother
      Gunga roaring in the dark, and so came quickly from a hut where I lay
      warm. And what have ye done to Karma, that he is so wet and silent? And
      what does Mother Gunga here? Are the heavens full that ye must come
      paddling in the mud beast-wise? Karma, what do they do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gunga has prayed for a vengeance on the bridge-builders, and Kali is with
      her. Now she bids Hanuman whelm the bridge, that her honour may be made
      great,&rdquo; cried the Parrot. &ldquo;I waited here, knowing that thou wouldst come,
      O my master!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Heavenly Ones said nothing? Did Gunga and the Mother of Sorrows
      out-talk them? Did none speak for my people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Ganesh, moving uneasily from foot to foot; &ldquo;I said it was but
      dirt at play, and why should we stamp it flat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was content to let them toil&mdash;well content,&rdquo; said Hanuman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had I to do with Gunga&rsquo;s anger?&rdquo; said the Bull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Bhairon of the Common Folk, and this my staff is Kotwal of all
      Kashi. I spoke for the Common People.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou?&rdquo; The young God&rsquo;s eyes sparkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I not the first of the Gods in their mouths to-day?&rdquo; returned Bhairon,
      unabashed. &ldquo;For the sake of the Common People I said&mdash;very many wise
      things which I have now forgotten, but this my staff-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Krishna turned impatiently, saw the Mugger at his feet, and kneeling,
      slipped an arm round the cold neck. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;get thee to
      thy flood again. The matter is not for thee. What harm shall thy honour
      take of this live dirt? Thou hast given them their fields new year after
      year, and by thy flood they are made strong. They come all to thee at the
      last. What need to slay them now? Have pity, mother, for a little&mdash;and
      it is only for a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it be only for a little,&rdquo; the slow beast began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they Gods, then?&rdquo; Krishna returned with a laugh, his eyes looking
      into the dull eyes of the River. &ldquo;Be certain that it is only for a little.
      The Heavenly Ones have heard thee, and presently justice will be done. Go
      now, mother, to the flood again. Men and cattle are thick on the waters&mdash;the
      banks fall&mdash;the villages melt because of thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the bridge&mdash;the bridge stands.&rdquo; The Mugger turned grunting into
      the undergrowth as Krishna rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is ended,&rdquo; said the Tigress, viciously. &ldquo;There is no more justice from
      the Heavenly Ones. Ye have made shame and sport of Gunga, who asked no
      more than a few score lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of my people&mdash;who lie under the leaf-roofs of the village yonder&mdash;of
      the young girls, and the young men who sing to them in the dark&mdash;of
      the child that will be born next morn&mdash;of that which was begotten
      to-night,&rdquo; said Krishna. &ldquo;And when all is done, what profit? To-morrow
      sees them at work. Ay, if ye swept the bridge out from end to end they
      would begin anew. Hear me! Bhairon is drunk always. Hanuman mocks his
      people with new riddles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, but they are very old ones,&rdquo; the Ape said, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shiv hears the talk of the schools and the dreams of the holy men; Ganesh
      thinks only of his fat traders; but I&mdash;I live with these my people,
      asking for no gifts, and so receiving them hourly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And very tender art thou of thy people,&rdquo; said the Tigress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are my own. The old women dream of me turning in their sleep; the
      maids look and listen for me when they go to fill their lotahs by the
      river. I walk by the young men waiting without the gates at dusk, and I
      call over my shoulder to the white-beards. Ye know, Heavenly Ones, that I
      alone of us all walk upon the earth continually, and have no pleasure in
      our heavens so long as a green blade springs here, or there are two voices
      at twilight in the standing crops. Wise are ye, but ye live far off;
      forgetting whence ye came. So do I not forget. And the fire-carriage feeds
      your shrines, ye say? And the fire-carriages bring a thousand pilgrims
      where but ten came in the old years? True. That is true, to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But to-morrow they are dead, brother,&rdquo; said Ganesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; said the Bull, as Hanuman leaned forward again. &ldquo;And to-morrow,
      beloved&mdash;what of to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This only. A new word creeping from mouth to mouth among the Common Folk&mdash;a
      word that neither man nor God can lay hold of&mdash;an evil word&mdash;a
      little lazy word among the Common Folk, saying (and none know who set that
      word afoot) that they weary of ye, Heavenly Ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Gods laughed together softly. &ldquo;And then, beloved,&rdquo; they said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to cover that weariness they, my people, will bring to thee, Shiv,
      and to thee, Ganesh, at first greater offerings and a louder noise of
      worship. But the word has gone abroad, and, after, they will pay fewer
      dues to your fat Brahmins. Next they will forget your altars, but so
      slowly that no man can say how his forgetfulness began.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew&mdash;I knew! I spoke this also, but they would not hear,&rdquo; said
      the Tigress. &ldquo;We should have slain-we should have slain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is too late now. Ye should have slain at the beginning when the men
      from across the water had taught our folk nothing. Now my people see their
      work, and go away thinking. They do not think of the Heavenly Ones
      altogether. They think of the fire-carriage and the other things that the
      bridge-builders have done, and when your priests thrust forward hands
      asking alms, they give a little unwillingly. That is the beginning, among
      one or two, or five or ten&mdash;for I, moving among my people, know what
      is in their hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the end, Jester of the Gods? What shall the end be?&rdquo; said Ganesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The end shall be as it was in the beginning, O slothful son of Shiv! The
      flame shall die upon the altars and the prayer upon the tongue till ye
      become little Gods again&mdash;Gods of the jungle&mdash;names that the
      hunters of rats and noosers of dogs whisper in the thicket and among the
      caves&mdash;rag-Gods, pot Godlings of the tree, and the village-mark, as
      ye were at the beginning. That is the end, Ganesh, for thee, and for
      Bhairon&mdash;Bhairon of the Common People.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very far away,&rdquo; grunted Bhairon. &ldquo;Also, it is a lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many women have kissed Krishna. They told him this to cheer their own
      hearts when the grey hairs came, and he has told us the tale,&rdquo; said the
      Bull, below his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their Gods came, and we changed them. I took the Woman and made her
      twelve-armed. So shall we twist all their Gods,&rdquo; said Hanuman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Their Gods! This is no question of their Gods&mdash;one or three&mdash;man
      or woman. The matter is with the people. I move, and not the Gods of the
      bridge-builders,&rdquo; said Krishna.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it. I have made a man worship the fire-carriage as it stood still
      breathing smoke, and he knew not that he worshipped me,&rdquo; said Hanuman the
      Ape. &ldquo;They will only change a little the names of their Gods. I shall lead
      the builders of the bridges as of old; Shiv shall be worshipped in the
      schools by such as doubt and despise their fellows; Ganesh shall have his
      mahajuns, and Bhairon the donkey-drivers, the pilgrims, and the sellers of
      toys. Beloved, they will do no more than change the names, and that we
      have seen a thousand times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely they will do no more than change the names,&rdquo; echoed Ganesh; but
      there was an uneasy movement among the Gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will change more than the names. Me alone they cannot kill, so long
      as a maiden and a man meet together or the spring follows the winter
      rains. Heavenly Ones, not for nothing have I walked upon the earth. My
      people know not now what they know; but I, who live with them, I read
      their hearts. Great Kings, the beginning of the end is born already. The
      fire-carriages shout the names of new Gods that are not the old under new
      names. Drink now and eat greatly! Bathe your faces in the smoke of the
      altars before they grow cold! Take dues and listen to the cymbals and the
      drums, Heavenly Ones, while yet there are flowers and songs. As men count
      time the end is far off; but as we who know reckon it is to-day. I have
      spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young God ceased, and his brethren looked at each other long in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This I have not heard before,&rdquo; Peroo whispered in his companion&rsquo;s ear.
      &ldquo;And yet sometimes, when I oiled the brasses in the engine-room of the
      Goorkha, I have wondered if our priests were so wise&mdash;so wise. The
      day is coming, Sahib. They will be gone by the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A yellow light broadened in the sky, and the tone of the river changed as
      the darkness withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the Elephant trumpeted aloud as though man had goaded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let Indra judge. Father of all, speak thou! What of the things we have
      heard? Has Krishna lied indeed? Or&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye know,&rdquo; said the Buck, rising to his feet. &ldquo;Ye know the Riddle of the
      Gods. When Brahm ceases to dream, the Heavens and the Hells and Earth
      disappear. Be content. Brahm dreams still. The dreams come and go, and the
      nature of the dreams changes, but still Brahm dreams. Krishna has walked
      too long upon earth, and yet I love him the more for the tale he has told.
      The Gods change, beloved&mdash;all save One!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, all save one that makes love in the hearts of men,&rdquo; said Krishna,
      knotting his girdle. &ldquo;It is but a little time to wait, and ye shall know
      if I lie. Truly it is but a little time, as thou sayest, and we shall
      know. Get thee to thy huts again, beloved, and make sport for the young
      things, for still Brahm dreams. Go, my children! Brahm dreams and till he
      wakes the Gods die not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whither went they?&rdquo; said the Lascar, awe-struck, shivering a little with
      the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; said Findlayson. The river and the island lay in full
      daylight now, and there was never mark of hoof or pug on the wet earth
      under the peepul. Only a parrot screamed in the branches, bringing down
      showers of water-drops as he fluttered his wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up! We are cramped with cold! Has the opium died out. Canst thou move,
      Sahib?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Findlayson staggered to his feet and shook himself. His bead swam and
      ached, but the work of the opium was over, and, as he sluiced his forehead
      in a pool, the Chief Engineer of the Kashi Bridge was wondering how he had
      managed to fall upon the island, what chances the day offered of return,
      and, above all, how his work stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peroo, I have forgotten much I was under the guard-tower watching the
      river; and then&mdash;Did the flood sweep us away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. The boats broke loose, Sahib, and,&rdquo; (if the Sahib had forgotten about
      the opium, decidedly Peroo would not remind him) &ldquo;in striving to retie
      them, so it seemed to me but it was dark&mdash;a rope caught the Sahib and
      threw him upon a boat. Considering that we two, with Hitchcock Sahib,
      built, as it were, that bridge, I came also upon the boat, which came
      riding on horseback, as it were, on the nose of this island, and so,
      splitting, cast us ashore. I made a great cry when the boat left the wharf
      and without doubt Hitchcock Sahib will come for us. As for the bridge, so
      many have died in the building that it cannot fall.&rdquo; A fierce sun, that
      drew out all the smell of the sodden land, had followed the storm, and in
      that clear light there was no room for a man to think of the dreams of the
      dark. Findlayson stared upstream, across the blaze of moving water, till
      his eyes ached. There was no sign of any bank to the Ganges, much less of
      a bridge-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We came down far,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It was wonderful that we were not drowned a
      hundred times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the least of the wonder, for no man dies before his time. I have
      seen Sydney, I have seen London, and twenty great ports, but,&rdquo;&mdash;Peroo
      looked at the damp, discoloured shrine under the peepul&mdash;&ldquo;never man
      has seen that we saw here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has the Sahib forgotten; or do we black men only see the Gods?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a fever upon me.&rdquo; Findlayson was still looking uneasily across
      the water. &ldquo;It seemed that the island was full of beasts and men talking,
      but I do not remember. A boat could live in this water now, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! Then it is true. &lsquo;When Brahm ceases to dream, the Gods die.&rsquo; Now I
      know, indeed, what he meant. Once, too, the guru said as much to me; but
      then I did not understand. Now I am wise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Findlayson, over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peroo went on as if he were talking to himself &ldquo;Six&mdash;seven&mdash;ten
      monsoons since, I was watch on the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle of the Rewah&mdash;the
      Kumpani&rsquo;s big boat&mdash;and there was a big tufan; green and black water
      beating, and I held fast to the life-lines, choking under the waters. Then
      I thought of the Gods&mdash;of Those whom we saw to-night,&rdquo;&mdash;he
      stared curiously at Findlayson&rsquo;s back, but the white man was looking
      across the flood. &ldquo;Yes, I say of Those whom we saw this night past, and I
      called upon Them to protect me. And while I prayed, still keeping my
      lookout, a big wave came and threw me forward upon the ring of the great
      black bow-anchor, and the Rewah rose high and high, leaning towards the
      left-hand side, and the water drew away from beneath her nose, and I lay
      upon my belly, holding the ring, and looking down into those great deeps.
      Then I thought, even in the face of death: If I lose hold I die, and for
      me neither the Rewah nor my place by the galley where the rice is cooked,
      nor Bombay, nor Calcutta, nor even London, will be any more for me. &lsquo;How
      shall I be sure,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;that the Gods to whom I pray will abide at
      all?&rsquo; This I thought, and the Rewah dropped her nose as a hammer falls,
      and all the sea came in and slid me backwards along the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle and over
      the break of the fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;sle, and I very badly bruised my shin against the
      donkey-engine: but I did not die, and I have seen the Gods. They are good
      for live men, but for the dead. . . . They have spoken Themselves.
      Therefore, when I come to the village I will beat the guru for talking
      riddles which are no riddles. When Brahm ceases to dream the Gods go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look up-stream. The light blinds. Is there smoke yonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peroo shaded his eyes with his hands. &ldquo;He is a wise man and quick.
      Hitchcock Sahib would not trust a rowboat. He has borrowed the Rao Sahib&rsquo;s
      steam-launch, and comes to look for us. I have always said that there
      should have been a steam-launch on the bridge works for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The territory of the Rao of Baraon lay within ten miles of the bridge; and
      Findlayson and Hitchcock had spent a fair portion of their scanty leisure
      in playing billiards and shooting blackbuck with the young man. He had
      been bearded by an English tutor of sporting tastes for some five or six
      years, and was now royally wasting the revenues accumulated during his
      minority by the Indian Government. His steam-launch, with its
      silver-plated rails, striped silk awning, and mahogany decks, was a new
      toy which Findlayson had found horribly in the way when the Rao came to
      look at the bridge works.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great luck,&rdquo; murmured Findlayson, but he was none the less afraid,
      wondering what news might be of the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gaudy blue-and-white funnel came downstream swiftly. They could see
      Hitchcock in the bows, with a pair of opera-glasses, and his face was
      unusually white. Then Peroo hailed, and the launch made for the tail of
      the island. The Rao Sahib, in tweed shooting-suit and a seven-hued turban,
      waved his royal hand, and Hitchcock shouted. But he need have asked no
      questions, for Findlayson&rsquo;s first demand was for his bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All serene! &lsquo;Gad, I never expected to see you again, Findlayson. You&rsquo;re
      seven koss downstream. Yes; there&rsquo;s not a stone shifted anywhere; but how
      are you? I borrowed the Rao Sahib&rsquo;s launch, and he was good enough to come
      along. Jump in. Ah, Finlinson, you are very well, eh? That was most
      unprecedented calamity last night, eh? My royal palace, too, it leaks like
      the devil, and the crops will also be short all about my country. Now you
      shall back her out, Hitchcock. I&mdash;I do not understand steam-engines.
      You are wet? You are cold, Finlinson? I have some things to eat here, and
      you will take a good drink.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m immensely grateful, Rao Sahib. I believe you&rsquo;ve saved my life. How
      did Hitchcock&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! His hair was upon end. He rode to me in the middle of the night and
      woke me up in the arms of Morpheus. I was most truly concerned, Finlinson,
      so I came too. My head-priest he is very angry just now. We will go quick,
      Mister Hitchcock. I am due to attend at twelve forty-five in the state
      temple, where we sanctify some new idol. If not so I would have asked you
      to spend the day with me. They are dam-bore, these religious ceremonies,
      Finlinson, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peroo, well known to the crew, had possessed himself of the inlaid wheel,
      and was taking the launch craftily up-stream. But while he steered he was,
      in his mind, handling two feet of partially untwisted wire-rope; and the
      back upon which he beat was the back of his guru.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
